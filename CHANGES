* 0.5.0.0

  - started recording a CHANGELOG
  - use the new bytestring builder and the dropped function
    'renderHtmlToByteStringIO', as the new bytestring builder does
    not support 'toByteStringIO'. 
  - use &#34; instead of &quot; to escape a doublequote, thus saving one byte
    per escaping
